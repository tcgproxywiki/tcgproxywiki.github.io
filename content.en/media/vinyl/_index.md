# Cardstock Workflow
Required materials: [cardstock](/media/vinyl/#cardstock) + [vinyl](/media/vinyl/#vinyl). Optional: [laminator](/hardware/laminator) + [laminator pouch](/hardware/laminator/#laminator-pouch)
{{% steps %}}
1. ## Choose your cardstock
    Choose thin cardstock if you want to laminate. Choose thick cardstock if you are not laminating.

2. ## Press vinyl sheet onto cardstock
    1) Peel a small section of the backing paper away from the vinyl
    2) Fold that small section of backing paper onto the remaining backing paper
    3) Flip the vinyl over and carefully align two corners to the cardstock
    4) Press the small section of vinyl onto the cardstock so the vinyl adhesive bonds to the cardstock
    5) Flip the remaining vinyl with backing paper over itself, so the backing paper is facing up
    6) Place your hand on the backing paper and push it towards the bottom of the cardstock
3. ## Print onto combined cardstock + vinyl
    Load the combined cardstock + vinyl sheet into your printer. You want to print directly onto the vinyl.
