# Introduction {anchor=false}
A TCG card is aproximately 12 mil (millions of an inch) thick. To choose the appropriate media you need to add each layer's thickness together.

# Example media combinations
## [Paper](/media/paper)
- Laminated
  - 3 mil [laminator pouch](/hardware/laminator/#laminator-pouch) + ~10 mil [paper](/media/paper/)= 13 mil
- Unlaminated
  - ~5-15 mil [paper](/media/paper/)

## [Vinyl](/media/vinyl)
- Laminated cardstock + vinyl
  - 3 mil [laminator pouch](/hardware/laminator/#laminator-pouch) + ~6 mil [cardstock](/media/vinyl/#cardstock) + ~3 mil = 12 mil
- Unlaminated cardstock + vinyl
  - ~10 mil [cardstock](/media/vinyl/#cardstock) + ~3 mil = 13 mil
- Unlaminated [existing card](/media/vinyl/#existing-card-workflow) + vinyl
  - ~12 mil + ~3 mil = 15 mil
