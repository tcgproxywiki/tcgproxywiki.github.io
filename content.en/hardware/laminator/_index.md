# Basic Laminator Workflow

{{% steps %}}
1. ## Pre-heat laminator
    Let your laminator continue to heat up even after indicator says it is ready

2. ## Insert printed media in pouch
    Press down so pouch adheres to the paper before next step

3. ## Feed pouch through lamintor
    Slowly feed the pouch and media into the laminator

4. ## Wait and Repeat
    Wait before starting the next page so the rollers can heat up again

5. ## Second pass (optional)
    Run the cards back through once cut. This way they get more of the heat actually applied to the laminate before all the heat runs out.
